CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
1. INTRODUCTION
By virtue of the principle of proportionality and in order to facilitate compliance with
the National Security Framework (ENS) for certain entities or specific sectors of activity,
specific compliance profiles may be implemented, comprising that set of security
measures which, as a result of the mandatory risk analysis, are applicable to a specific
category of security.
The CCN-STIC Guides of the National Cryptologic Centre may establish specific
compliance profiles for specific entities or sectors, which will include the list of measures
and reinforcements applicable in each case, or the criteria for their determination.
The National Cryptologic Centre, in the exercise of its competences, will validate and
publish the corresponding specific compliance profiles that are defined, allowing those
entities within its scope of application to achieve a better and more efficient adaptation
to the ENS, rationalising the resources required without detriment to the protection
pursued and enforceable.
The audits shall be carried out according to the category of the system and, where
appropriate, the specific compliance profile that corresponds, in accordance with the
provisions of Annex I and Annex III of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3 May, and in
accordance with the provisions of the Technical Security Instruction on Auditing the
Security of Information Systems.
To this end, following a study of security needs, resources and a risk analysis of the
vulnerabilities and threats to which the Paying Agencies are exposed, and with the aim
of guaranteeing maximum security of the information systems, the mandate imposed
on the CCN is fulfilled by validating the following Specific Compliance Profile for Paying
Agencies, which allows the implementation of the ENS in them, with MEDIUM category
security needs.
In the process of drawing up the specific compliance profile of the paying agencies of
European funds, an exhaustive analysis was carried out of the regulations involved, the
requirements imposed by the European legislator1, the requirements derived from the
National Security Framework [Royal Decree 311/2022], of 3rd May, the implications of
third parties in the activities and functions and the particularities of the obliged party.
The national coordination agency and representative Agencies have collaborated in this
process.
Thanks to their collaboration, the CCN has been able to design and deploy a profile
adapted to the legislative reality and particularities of the organisations under analysis.
1 Mainly Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2021
on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing
Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/127 of 7 December
2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council with
rules on paying agencies and other Agencies, financial management, clearance of accounts, securities
and the use of the euro.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
As a final element, an Excel tool has been included to help with information related
to the application of the profile and synergies of the rules affecting the paying agencies.
2. OBJECT
This guide is the result of the application of article 30 of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3rd
May, on the basis of which and in accordance with the principles of proportionality and
efficiency and effectiveness, the Specific Compliance Profile for Paying and Coordination
Agencies is presented, specifying and adapting certain requirements of the National
Security Framework for these subjects.
Let us not forget that these agencies must comply with the requirements established by
the European legislator, which necessarily imply an information security system based
on the security standard2 . By applying this profile, paying agencies will indirectly benefit
from the implementation of a single security framework3 for their information systems.
However, certification requirements can be modulated based on the responsibility for
the management and control of annual expenditure under the EUR 400 million limit4.
The CCN has been aware of the significant differences that exist between paying
agencies based on their responsibility for managing the amounts of EAFRD and EAGF
aid, and the Compliance Profile presented considers different levels of requirements
based on this certification obligation that falls on some of them.
Agencies will have to analyse the level of requirements that apply to them under the
European legislator and proceed to deploy the requirements set out. 5
It is not the purpose of this guide to provide a detailed analysis of the standards and to
deploy an equivalence of compliance at European level and the differentiated
application of ENS controls and reinforcements.6
2 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/127 of 7 December 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU)
2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council with rules concerning paying agencies and other
Agencies, financial management, clearance of accounts, securities and the use of the euro (hereinafter
Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127), Annex I, 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, point (B),
"The security of information systems shall be certified in accordance with ISO 27001: Information Security
management systems - Requirements (ISO) (ISO)."
3 Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127, Annex I, 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, point (B),
"Member States may, subject to authorisation by the Commission, certify the security of their information
systems in accordance with other accepted standards if these standards ensure a level of security at least
equivalent to that provided for in ISO 27001".
4 Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127 Annex I, 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, point B), "(...)
shall not apply to paying agencies responsible for the management and control of annual expenditure not
exceeding EUR 400 million, if the Member State concerned has informed the Commission of its decision to
apply".

Nor is it the purpose of this guide to analyse the requirement for certification of
standards other than the ENS itself, as each agency will have to analyse the need to
undergo other certification processes, and specifically those related to the requirements
of the European legislator.
3. SCOPE: PAYING AND COORDINATING AGENCIES
This profile applies exclusively to paying agencies and coordinating Agencies for
European agricultural funds, in accordance with the provisions of Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2022/127 of 7th December 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU)
2021/2116 of the European Parliament and of the Council with rules concerning paying
agencies and other agencies, financial management, clearance of accounts, securities
and the use of the euro Annex I, 3 Information and Communication, point B), as
certification of information systems of national paying agencies is considered possible,
with other standards ensuring a level equivalent to ISO 27001.
As provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) No 2021/2116 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 2nd December 2021 on the financing, management and
monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Regulation (EU) No
1306/2013, the paying agencies shall be the departments or agencies of the Member
States and, where appropriate, of the regions responsible for administering and
checking expenditure under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the
European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
The EU regime allows Member States to authorise the designation of several paying
agencies at regional level, in such cases establishing a single7 national coordinating
agency.
In addition, the European legislator has considered the possibility for paying agencies
to delegate the performance of tasks, with the exception of payments.8
And this is the present situation, so that in Spain there is one Coordinating Agency
and several paying agencies.
Therefore, the profile is aimed at; 9
systems in accordance with other accepted standards if these standards ensure a level of security at least
equivalent to that provided for in ISO 27001".
7 Regulation (EU) 2021/2116; Article 10 "Member States accrediting more than one paying agency shall
also designate a public coordinating body (...)".
8 Regulation (EU) 2021/2116; Article 9.1.1 "With the exception of making payments, the paying agencies
may delegate the performance of the tasks referred to in the first subparagraph".
9 Royal Decree 92/2018 of 2 March, regulating the system of paying agencies and coordination with
European agricultural funds, EAGF and EAFRD.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
a) National Coordination Agency; Spanish Agricultural Guarantee Fund,
Autonomous Agency (FEGA O.A.). Coordination agency10, understood as the
agency responsible, among other things, for centralising the information to be
made available to the European Commission, adopting or coordinating measures
aimed at resolving deficiencies, promoting and, where possible, guaranteeing the
harmonised application of EU regulations.
b) Paying Agencies; The Autonomous Communities will have a single paying agency
for the aids for which they are responsible for the management and control of
the payment of expenditure, charged to the European funds; European
Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural
Development (EAFRD).
These Agencies, in terms of information security requirements and this profile,
are differentiated in the following ways: 11
a. 400 million.
b. 400 million.
c) Delegated Agencies12; Paying agencies may delegate the performance of tasks,
except for the delegation of payment, in accordance with Regulation (EU)
2021/2116, subject to the conclusion of a written agreement, ensuring that
effective systems are in place in advance to ensure the delegated tasks and
verification of the fulfilment of obligations.13
Considering the differentiation of subjects that may exist in the EAGF and EAFRD aid
management ecosystem, for the purposes of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3rd May, the
following should be considered:
10 Consider the provisions regarding paying agency at national level in Article 9.2.3 of Regulation (EU)
2021/2116; "Where paying agencies are established at regional level, Member States shall, in addition,
accredit a paying agency at national level for aid Frameworkswhich by their nature are to be managed at
national level, or shall entrust the management of such Frameworks to their regional paying agencies".
11 Difference with significant impact, given that according to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127,
Annex I Authorisation Criteria, Article 1.3 Information and Communication, point B) Security of
Information Systems;
"The first and second subparagraphs shall not apply to paying agencies responsible for the management
and control of annual expenditure not exceeding EUR 400 million, if the Member State concerned has
informed the Commission of its decision to apply one of the following rules instead:
-International Standards Organisation 27002: Code of practice for Information Security management
(ISO),
-Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik: IT-Grundschutzhandbuch/IT Baseline Protection
Manual (BSI),
-Information Systems Audit and Control Association: Control objectives for Information and related
Technology (COBIT)".
12 The delegation of powers in relation to intervention measures, in accordance with Article 3 of Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2022/127, has not been specified.
13 For further details, see Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127, Annex I, 1.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
a) All subjects are Agencies subject to administrative regulations, being subjects of
the public sector and therefore being subject to Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3rd
May.
b) Paying agencies carrying out acts of delegation should consider the existence of
a delegation of functions assimilated to a supply chain [op.ext.3], and in any case
remain fully responsible for the legality and regularity of the underlying
transactions14, maintaining due diligence, requiring effective systems in the
delegating agencies and verifying regulatory compliance.
c) The coordinating agency can itself be a paying agency and can benefit from the
compliance profile, based on the annual expenditure limit of EUR 400 million.
Finally, consideration should be given to the existence of other public entities15
whose competences and functions are limited to technological services, infrastructure
and architecture management, management of communications and system
interconnections, coordination of technological services with third parties, system and
service redundancies, continuity plans and strategies, and other similar measures. This
is even more important for paying agencies, which must focus their efforts on
compliance with the internal structure and organisation declared by the European
legislator. For this reason, certain security measures may be delegated to these entities,
in their execution, but not in their responsibility, since the agency must ensure the
execution and verify that the compliance required by the measure is maintained. When
a delegation is made, the specific delegation and scope of the delegation, and the
agency's measures to ensure and verify compliance by the delegated public agency,
should be included in the statement of applicability of the relevant profile.
3.1 METHODOLOGY FOLLOWED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PROFILE
This profile has been developed thanks to the interaction of the subject concerned,
who has participated through a sample representation, in working meetings, which have
served to be able to know the risks present and to adapt the necessary measures that
have allowed to present the application of the ENS in a proportional way for the national
paying agencies.
These meetings have been held constantly over several months and have made it
possible to get to know the subject matter and the differences between them, to analyse
the particular legal requirements, to learn about the security trend presented, and to
adapt the requirements of the National Framework, in a compliance profile that seeks
to guarantee compliance with the ENS and full respect for the provisions of the
European legislator.
14 Annex I Royal Decree 311/2011, External Resources [op.ext] "When the organisation uses external
resources (services, products, facilities or personnel), it shall retain full responsibility for the risks to the
information processed or services provided, and shall take the necessary measures to exercise its
responsibility and maintain control at all times."
15 Subject in all respects to compliance with Royal Decree 311/2022.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
For the elaboration of this profile, the collaboration of the national coordinating
agency has been indispensable, as it has been an essential channel for unifying criteria
and needs. The European legislator has been respectful of the territorial and
jurisdictional distribution of the Member States, insofar as the existence of a national
coordinating agency [FEGA] and different paying agencies has been permitted.16
However, this provision implies 17 differentiated information systems in Spain, under
the umbrella of the autonomous regions and their differentiated security strategies, in
addition to the system of the national coordinating agency itself.
The main conclusions of this methodology have materialised in the profile presented
here, which can be summarised as follows:
a) Paying [and coordinating] agencies have particularities as a public sector subject,
both at the functional and competence level, as well as in their own information
system, interconnections, dependencies, delegations and supervisions, which
make the materialisation of a specific compliance profile desirable.
b) The paying agencies have differences in relation to the security obligations
imposed by the European legislator, in that a modulation of the obligations
imposed at national level for information security is advisable.
c) At the national level, they have a national coordinating agency that also works to
assist and collaborate with all agencies on security issues.
d) At a general level, dependencies of the regional paying agencies with other public
entities with technological competences are presented, which will have a
significant impact on security compliance and on the evidence that can be
presented in audits, especially those carried out to verify compliance with
European regulations on agricultural subsidies.17
e) Paying agencies are obliged by two standards of direct effect to develop an
information security management system, as it is necessary to facilitate
compliance with both standards, under the premises that the legislature has
given us.18
f) There is a common tendency for organisations or their technology managers to
study and deploy the CCN's security tools, as many of the security controls could
be deployed more easily than initially envisaged.
16 Consider the provisions regarding paying agency at national level in Article 9.2.3 of Regulation (EU)
2021/2116; "Where paying agencies are established at regional level, Member States shall, in addition,
accredit a paying agency at national level for aid Frameworks which by their nature are to be managed at
national level, or shall entrust the management of such Frameworks to their regional paying agencies".
17 Consider those review processes developed under Article 55 of Regulation (EU) 2021/2116, considering
the information security system required of paying agencies in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/127.
18 Both at the national level, Royal Decree 311/2022, enabling the development of specific compliance
profiles, and at the European level, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/127, with its ability to "authorise"
information security system certifications equivalent to ISO 27001.

3.2 ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
This is why special care has been taken in drawing up this specific compliance profile
to integrate the will of the European [and national] legislator. This analysis was
necessary in order to understand the nature, purpose, object and, in short, raison d'être
of the Paying Agencies. In order to do so, it was necessary to have a detailed knowledge
of the European regulations and their connection with the national implementing
regulations.
Thanks to this analysis, it was possible to know the services and the information handled
by the organisations and to initially draw up a category, in accordance with the
requirements and criteria of Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3rd May.
This is not an exhaustive list, but merely an enunciative one based on the importance
they have had in the present,19 has been considered:

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
4. SAFETY STANDARDS.
4.1 ENS RD 311/2022
Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3rd May, which regulates the new National Security
Framework, approves our (legal) cybersecurity framework.
The National Security Framework contains the basic principles and minimum
requirements necessary for adequate protection of the information processed and the
services provided by the entities subject to its application, in order to ensure access,
confidentiality, integrity, traceability, authenticity, availability and preservation of data,
information and services.
Information systems subject to the application of the ENS will be subject to a process to
determine their compliance with the ENS, and for this purpose, MEDIUM or HIGH
category systems will require an audit for the certification of their compliance, while
BASIC category systems will only require a self-assessment for their declaration of
compliance, without prejudice to the possibility that they may also be subject to a
certification audit.21
From the conclusions drawn during the process of analysing and adapting this profile, it
has emerged that the recommended category for paying agencies is the MEDIUM
category. However, there are adaptations in relation to specific measures, and on the
basis of responsibilities for the management of European expenditure.
4.2 ISO/IEC 27001
The ISO/IEC 27001:2013 / UNE-EN ISO/IEC 27001:2017, Information Security
Management Systems, currently coexists with the new version of the ISO /IEC22
27001:2022 Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection standard. This
coexistence will last for 36 months, an adaptation period in which entities must adapt
their systems to the latest version of the standard.
The ISO 27001 is a voluntary standard that uses the high-level structure of the ISO
standards, Annex (L), thus maintaining compatibility with other standards and whose
clauses are complemented by an Annex (A) that contains the list of security controls that
organisations must deploy in their systems. This international standard specifies the
requirements for the establishment, implementation, maintenance and continual
improvement of an information security management system in the context of an
organisation and includes requirements for the assessment and treatment of
information security risks. This standard is certifiable and can be complemented, with
21 Let us not forget that for the purposes of the provisions of Article 31 of Royal Decree 311/2022,
paragraph 2, "The audit will be carried out according to the category of the system and, where
appropriate, the specific compliance profile that corresponds, as set out in Annexes I and III and in
accordance with the provisions of the Technical Security Instruction on Security Auditing of Information
Systems".
22 ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical
Commission) constitute the specialised system for global standardisation.

other sources of controls, by the measures it includes for the security of the
organisations' systems23 .
4.3 EQUIVALENCE ANALYSIS BETWEEN SAFETY STANDARDS.
Throughout the process of developing this profile, a number of changes took place,
both at the legislative level and at the level of security standards.
Currently, two ISO 27001 standards coexist (the 2013 version and the 2022 version),
both of which are certifiable. For this reason, it was necessary to carry out an
equivalence analysis of both standards and, subsequently, of these standards with the
ENS.
4.3.1 ISO 27001:2013 - ENS
At a high level, from the analysis carried out, it can be considered that ISO 27001 in
its 2013 version requires additional controls in order to be equivalent to the ENS in its
entire application, given that it does not consider certain security measures that are
contemplated by Annex II of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3rd May.
However, the ISO standard is flexible in this respect and allows the addition of source
systems to its Annex A controls, in that all those measures and/or reinforcements in
Annex II of Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3rd May, which are not considered by the 2013
standard, can be added.
On the other hand, at the ENS level, continuity and alternativity controls [op.cont]
should be considered to achieve full equivalence, since for the ENS they are not
applicable controls in the MEDIUM category.
4.3.2 ISO 27001:2013 - ISO 27001:2022
ISO/IEC 27001:2022 "Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection -
Information security management systems - Requirements", heir to the previous
ISO/IEC 27001:2013 after the corresponding revision and evolution, presents a
significant change in the structure of Annex A, by regrouping the controls in four large
blocks; Organisational controls; People controls; Physical controls; Technological
controls.
From 114 controls, the number of controls has been reduced to 93, which have been
restructured into 4 major domains or chapters and new controls have been added:
5. 7Threat intelligence
5. 23Information security for the use of cloud services
23 For example, ISO 27017 controls, related to cloud security, can be added. ISO/IEC 27017:2015

4.3.3 ISO /IEC 27002: 2022: Code of practice for information security
management
The ISO/IEC 27002: 2022 is designed to be used as an application guide or reference
for determining and implementing controls for the treatment of information security
risks in an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on ISO/IEC 27001. It
can also be used as a guidance and implementation document for commonly accepted
information security controls, as it can enrich other security frameworks, such as the
National Security Framework.
This standard is not certifiable, so systems based on this standard may be eligible for
certification under the ISO 27001 requirements standard.
On a general level, the 2022 version of the standard has measures that are more in
line with Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3 May, having deployed much needed controls in
the new cybersecurity scenario.
4.3.4 ISO 27001: 2022-ENS
A global equivalence of the controls of Annex A of ISO 27001:2022 and Royal Decree
311/2022, of 3 May, has been carried out in order to demonstrate the synergy of the
two standards, and to align the specific security profile of paying agencies.24

Although the purpose may be similar, one of the standards is more demanding and its purpose is more
extensive.
In the requirements analysis of the control analysed, it has been concluded that there is no equivalence.
Null One of the standards does not consider the control analysed.
One of the standards has deployed a control for a purpose that is not pursued by the other standard.
See the annex to this profile for details of the analysis carried out. This annex can help
the target subjects to align their currently deployed management systems with Royal
Decree 311/2022.
4.3.5 Conclusion analysis of security standards
From the above, we can consider:
a) Analysis of Royal Decree 311/2022 and ISO 27001: 2013.
 The level of equivalence of the two standards is low, given that the Royal
Decree has evolved in terms of stringency and security, while the standard
remains at a discreet security level that does not consider the profile of
new security threats and risks.
b) Analysis of Royal Decree 311/2022 and ISO 27001: 2022.
 The level of equivalence is good. Both standards have evolved in terms of
security and consideration of new risks, in a cloud and vendor-dependent
environment.25
 Equivalence can be considered by means of a compliance profile starting
from an MEDIUM category and considering the specific modulation;
i. Reduction of some requirement set in MEDIUM category
measures as the ISO standard does not consider the measure as
rigorously (e.g. configuration or certified components).
25 It has been analysed in relation to the direct application on a subject likely to certify
its system under the ISO standard.

4.4 ANALYSIS OF PAYING AGENCIES' SYSTEMS AND SCOPES. BASELINE
SITUATION: CERTIFICATIONS AND SCOPES
4.4.1 Introduction.
Throughout the profiling process, the differences in paying agencies and specifically,
the information systems deployed and alignment processes followed were analysed.
As of the date of information collection, 10 organisations, including FEGA, had
developed certification processes based on ISO/IEC 27001:2013. In addition, there are 6
Agencies, including FEGA, that had carried out ENS compliance processes, 5 of which did
so in the MEDIUM category and one in the BASIC category. In addition, there is one
entity that has carried out a SELF-ASSESSMENT.
The categorisation presented has also been analysed, so that, with some exceptions,
all systems are oriented towards an MEDIUM category.
4.4.2 Analysis of Inventories of information and services.
In order to make a proposal for an inventory of services and information on the
subjects, the inventory of FEGA and some sample territorial paying agencies were taken
into consideration.
In making a proposal it should be considered that each agency has its own
particularities, but we should stick to what is required by the ENS without diverting
attention from the European regulation.
For this reason, it has been considered useful to present a neutral inventory model,
which brings together the requirements of the national and European legislator, and
which analyses the required category of the system under the premises of Annex I of
Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3rd May.

4.5 PROPOSAL FOR A UNIFIED SCOPE UNDER A COMPLIANCE PROFILE
In order to facilitate homogenisation in the assessment of services and information
and a system model, a MEDIUM categorisation is proposed in accordance with Annex I
of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3 May, assessed on the basis of the provisions of Annex I
of this decree and specifying the criteria by means of the provisions of guide CCN-STIC
803.
The following scopes for information systems are also proposed, so that the same
scope can be used to evidence an information security management system under the
specific paying agency security profile developed under the provisions of Article 30 of
Royal Decree 311/2022 [equivalent to ISO 27001].
Proposal A:
The information systems supporting the services provided for the management of
aid and payments of EAGF and EAFRD funds under the responsibility of the paying
agency, in accordance with the Statement of Applicability of the specific compliance
profile for paying agencies.
Proposal B27:
Information system necessary for the provision of services required for the
management of aid and payments under the responsibility of the paying agency for
EAGF and EAFRD funds (application, processing, management, payment proposal,
authorisation, control, payment execution, management of advances and guarantees,
debt management, treasury and accounting), in accordance with (the security
requirements set out in Royal Decree 311/2022, in accordance with) the Statement of
Applicability of the specific compliance profile for paying agencies.
27 This proposal is in line with most of the scopes presented by the paying agencies analysed during the
work. It details the processes associated with the services covered.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
4.6 ENS CONFORMITY FOR THE EU
Given the provision in Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127 that Member States
may, subject to authorisation by the Commission, certify the security of their
information systems in accordance with other accepted standards if these standards
ensure a level of security at least equivalent to that provided for in ISO 27001,
consideration should be given to the possibility for the Commission to authorise Spain
to certify systems in accordance with the provisions of this profile.
4.7 SPECIFIC COMPLIANCE PROFILE FOR PAYING AGENCIES.
A specific Compliance Profile adapted to Paying Agencies is presented. However,
given the particularity that exists, and that the Agencies are subject to differentiated
responsibilities based on the management and control of a limited annual expenditure
based on the amount of EUR 400 million, the profile is presented in two (2) levels of ENS
compliance, namely:
a) Specific Compliance Profile for paying agencies managing aid over 400 million
euros.
b) Specific Compliance Profile for paying agencies managing aid of less than EUR 400
million.
This difference in amount means that organisations may be obliged to certify their
management systems according to ISO 27001 when they are responsible for the
management and control of amounts above EUR 400 million or, on the contrary, when
the amount is lower, they are allowed to deploy a management system based on the
Code of Best Practice for Information Security Management based on ISO 27002.
And the CCN cannot be oblivious to the differentiation and forces us to accept the
lower risk perceived by the European legislator and the lowering of conditions in the
deployment of a security standard. For this reason, when designing this specific profile,
a difference in the application of some measures has been considered, being stricter or,
where appropriate, lowered, based on the requirements of the Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2022/127 for an organisation. If ISO certification is required, the compliance profile
will be rigorous and stricter, whereas, if ISO 27002 best practices are allowed to be
deployed, the profile may have reduced requirements for some measures.
The following shows what the compliance profile looks like:

4.8 MEASURES SHARED WITH OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR ENTITIES
It has already been pointed out that there are two particularities in relation to paying
agencies: on the one hand, the possibility of delegating to other entities and agencies,
as recognised by the European legislator30, always with the express prohibition of
delegation of payment.
On the other hand, within the very synergy of the public sector, it may be common
the existence of public entities with competence in specific infrastructures or services,
affecting the management of security measures, which will coexist with the paying
agency's responsibility for them.
Some of the IT assets involved in security fall under the responsibility of Directorates
or Autonomous Public Agencies other than the Paying Agency itself. For example, at the
network or communications level, network management does not depend on the Paying
Agency, or at the infrastructure or Data Processing Centre level, the Agency is not the
owner and depends on the Directorate General / Regional Ministry on which it depends
organically.
Given this particularity, a distribution of responsibilities for control compliance has
been added in Annex I, which may be useful in certification processes or burden sharing
and modelling of compliance with the controls present in the specific compliance profile,
i.e. greater or lesser stringency in the compliance of a control for the paying agency.
It is important that paying agencies add appropriate justification in their statements
of applicability, specify the delegated functions and clearly detail the controls they will
put in place to ascertain and verify compliance. These measures may include internal or
external audits.
As part of the national strategy to increase security in the public sector, it is
recommended that the tools offered by the CCN31 be deployed.

CCN-STIC-852 CCN-STIC 852 - Specific Compliance Profile Paying Agencies
Considering the necessary existence of a central coordinating agency (mandated by
the European legislator) and considering the existence of a National Authority that
monitors and promotes compliance with the security of services and information:
a) The tools and guidelines of the CCN can be a great alliance to unify security
criteria, overcoming the differences in regional management and facilitating the
understanding of the Commission in the application of security, providing mutual
trust, creating synergies between similar subjects, and all this on the basis of the
existence of 17 paying agencies to be controlled in a state.
b) The premises given by a national coordination agency can be a great alliance to
unify assessment criteria, security tools and services and adequate components
for the management of European aid and funds.
5. DECLARATION OF APPLICABILITY OF THE PAYING AGENCY SPECIFIC
COMPLIANCE PROFILE
The statement of applicability is the set of measures that are applicable for
compliance with the ENS. The set of measures will depend on the levels associated with
the security dimensions.
It has been determined that, in order to guarantee security in the systems referred
to in this Specific Compliance Profile, the list of measures to be applied and the security
level requirement of each measure applied is as indicated in the following table.
As the degree of enforcement may be different for each type of paying agency profile,
a separation is presented in the table of applicable measures.
The symbol "*" indicates that the measure concerned has specific implementation
criteria, which are detailed in section "6.
Therefore, when a measure is affected, it shall be specified with an asterisk "*" in the
table below, above the category. A category change or a reinforcement to be applied
(+R) may be referenced.

Monitoring solutions will be available to determine the exposure surface
in relation to vulnerabilities and configuration deficiencies. This can be
done by deploying functions through CCN solutions or, where
appropriate, CVE analysis through official sources and lists.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | It is important that the OOPP deploys a policy or is attached to that of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | the superior administrative entity. It is important that the custody and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | use of the signature is managed. In this environment, special |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | consideration will be given to cloud services and specific agreements |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | with other public entities or third parties may need to be deployed. HSM |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | services may be deployed, which should be ENS-compliant. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Within the same, consideration should be given to the processes in |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | which signature verification must be maintained and therefore deploy |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | preservation environments, which allow for such verification. These |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | environments can be in an in-house or third-party service. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Although not applicable, the OOPP may deploy certified components |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | according to [op.pl.5]. |

NP 10 <br> Internet Access <br> Standards | The two standards are closely aligned in this control. Web filtering can <br> include a variety of techniques including signatures, list of acceptable <br> websites or domains, list of banned websites or domains, and custom <br> configuration to help prevent software and other malicious activities <br> from affecting the organisation's network and systems. Actions such as <br> automatic blocking and training and awareness should be considered, <br> always aligned with other controls. However, the OOPP may not <br> manage the network services and so it may be the responsibility of a <br> different entity or vendor to manage and deploy some of the measures <br> described. It is true that the agency can manage some of the control <br> through security tools, such as malware prevention software and <br> monitoring the user's actions on the network. <br> Browser configurations according to [op.exp.2] and [op.exp.3] should be <br> considered. |

(Cloud services are characterised by elasticity and <br> scalability that allow rapid expansion and reduction on demand of <br> available resources for particular applications and services, which is <br> useful to reduce the demand on the organisation's resources). |
