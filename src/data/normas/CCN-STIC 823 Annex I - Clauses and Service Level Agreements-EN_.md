1. ANNEX I Clauses and Service Level Agreements
1.1 Conformity with the National Security Scheme (in Spanish, ENS)
Note: In case of procurement of cloud services through an intermediary entity acting as a
service provider (TENDERING or AWARDING ENTITY), but which does not own the systems that
will provide the cloud services, it will be necessary to also require ENS compliance to the end
systems providing the cloud services, owned by the end cloud service provider.
Considering the provisions of Article 29 of Royal Decree 3/2010, of 8 January, which
regulates the National Security Scheme in the field of Electronic Administration, and the
Resolution of 13 October 2016, of the Secretary of State for Public Administrations, which
approves the Technical Instruction on Security in accordance with the National Security
Scheme, which describes the obligation to require private sector operators providing
services or solutions to public entities, In accordance with the National Security Scheme,
the CONTRACTING ENTITY deems necessary that the suppliers participating in the tender
in question shall exhibit the corresponding Statement of Conformity with the National
Security Scheme (when the system category is BASIC), or the Certification of Conformity
with the National Security Scheme (when the category is MEDIUM or HIGH).
Therefore, based on the above, and on the analysis of risks to which the services
subject to the tender are exposed, the CONTRACTING ENTITY, establishes as necessary
that the TENDERING ENTITY shall have the corresponding Statement or Certification of
Compliance with the National Security Scheme, according to the relevant category of
security, of the systems involved in the provision of the services indicated, and it should
maintain the compliance in force during the term of the contract. In the event that the
successful tenderer is unable to maintain compliance with the NSS - due to loss,
withdrawal or suspension of the Compliance Certification or impossibility of maintaining
the Compliance Declaration - it must communicate this circumstance immediately and
without undue delay to the CONTRACTING ENTITY, which will consider the impact of this
circumstance on the provision of the services covered by the contract.
When the contract covers, totally or partially, the use of on-premise systems (e.g.
software), in accordance with the provisions of the CCN-STIC Guide 858 Implementation
of SaaS systems in local mode (on-premise), the TENDERING ENTITY must provide the
following documents: Installation Guide (addressed to administrators), the Secure Use
Guide (addressed to users) and the Supplier-Customer Relationship Guide.
The AWARDEE assumes its obligation to comply fully with the National Security
Scheme, and with the need for the information systems of those suppliers that are
essential for the provision of the service covered by the contract to comply with Royal
Decree 3/2010 of 8 January.
