1. INTRODUCTION
The challenges currently presented by the use of technological MEDIUM, as well as the
unceasing evolution of so-called disruptive technologies, are posing an enormous challenge for
global cybersecurity strategies. The speed of technological evolution and the growing dependence
of societies on such MEDIUM is parallel to the increase in the risks and threats associated with
their use, requiring more sophisticated responses, adapted to reality and coordinated between
the different agents involved.
It has been in this scenario where the most significant cybersecurity frameworks1 have evolved,
thanks to the efforts of the different entities and authorities responsible, which, in many cases,
have resulted in legal regulations, with the aim of promoting and homogenising security in the
states.
As we have said, in the current context, threats represent a serious problem for the functioning
of the social, political and economic activities of states, which has led to the emergence, at the
international, European and national levels, of norms that aim to provide an adequate response
to these challenges.
The effort to increase cybersecurity levels, through the evolution of regulations and standards
on information security, has resulted in the updating of two key standards for cybersecurity in our
country: Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3 May, which regulates the National Security Framework (ENS)
and the ISO/IEC 27001:2022, Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection -
Information security management systems - Requirements2. Both texts have undergone significant
modifications to address the challenges arising from new threats, strengthening security
programmes and initiatives, and facilitating compatibility between them and their security
measures and controls.
The CCN, aware of the existence of different regulatory frameworks, both at European and
international level, has developed this document to facilitate the integration and implementation
of these standards, pointing out what they have in common'.
As a [legal] framework for cybersecurity, the National Security Framework3 requires compliance
with the minimum principles and requirements established4, adopting the corresponding security
measures and reinforcements, established in Annex II. In order to implement these measures, it is
necessary to first consider the category of the system, as provided for in Article 40 and detailed in
Annex I, the assets that form part of the information system and the management of information
security risks.
The National Security Framework itself recognises the possibility of deploying additional
security measures, at the discretion of the Security Officer. Moreover, within this flexibility to
adapt to the needs of the information system and the risks detected, the measures themselves
can be "modulated" or "replaced" by compensatory or complementary measures, which, while
1 Such is the case of Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3 May, which regulates the National Security Framework (ENS).
2 UNE-ISO/IEC 27001:2023 "Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection. Information security management systems.
Requirements"
3 Article 28. Compliance with minimum requirements.

fulfilling the same purpose as those replaced, can achieve at least equivalent security and
protection.
Cybersecurity framework.
In today's technological and interconnected environment, different [cyber]security frameworks
coexist, which strive to develop guidelines for comprehensive risk management, and to reduce,
detect, react and recover from any [cyber]security attack. These frameworks certainly coexist and
interrelate with the National Security Framework and allow for a holistic view of security in today's
entire cyber-technology environment.
The National Security Framework is closely related to ISO/IEC 27001:2022, but there are other
frameworks that are of great relevance:
Organisation Cyber]security framework
Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
A voluntary cybersecurity framework developed by NIST5, which allows
organisations to develop their cybersecurity and risk management
programmes, with the characteristic of adaptability and flexibility. It is
thus a standard that can be used by organisations of any size and sector.
Adherence to it is voluntary. This framework deploys the entire
NIST National Institute of Standards
programme on five differentiated functions; identify, protect, detect,
and Technology
respond and recover and a differentiated scale of maturity.
https://www.nist.gov
NIST SP 800-53
A security and privacy framework for information systems and
organisations, which includes a catalogue of controls to protect the
organisation's operations and assets. Equivalences can be found between
different frameworks, such as ISO 27001. NIST 800-53 provides security
controls to help deploy NIST CSF6.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has developed a certification
process7 with similarities to the National Security Framework, aimed at
National Cyber Security Centre
assessing cyber security expertise, products and services independently
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/
according to its own standards. There are different accreditation
Frameworks, either for products or for services.
Cloud Controls Matrix - CMM v4. 8
Control framework developed by CSA, consisting of 197 control objectives
distributed in 17 domains, related to key elements of cloud security. This
Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) framework is aimed at improving the security and implementation of
https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/ controls for different cloud services. Its equivalence matrices with other
security standards, such as ISO 27001/27002/27017/27018, NIST SP 800-
53, AICPA TSC, German BSI C5, PCI DSS, ISACA COBIT, NERC CIP, FedRamp,
CIS, may be useful.
CIS is a non-profit organisation working on cyber security. It has
developed the CIS Controls and CIS Benchmarks security standards. It also
develops other security work based on global best practices.
CIS Controls
Center for Internet Security [CIS].
It includes a set of controls9 that have been prioritised and that, under
https://www.cisecurity.org
cybersecurity best practices, present blocks of prevention, protection,
response and recovery actions. These controls are distributed in security
requirements organised in 3 categories, basic controls, fundamental
controls, and organisational controls.

Among the checkpoints that CIS has incorporated are PCI DSS10, HIPAA11
and RGPD12.
COBIT13
ISACA Security framework developed by ISACA for IT governance and
https://www.isaca.org management, modular and adaptable to organisations. It works on 5
domain blocks in which 40 processes are deployed.
To which ISO/IEC 27001:2022 should be added. ISO14 27001 is a voluntary standard that uses
the high-level structure of ISO standards, Annex (L), to maintain compatibility with other ISO
standards. It has a set of general clauses and an Annex (A) that contains the list of security controls
that organisations must deploy in their systems.
2. OBJECT
This document shows the compatible measures between the National Security Framework and
the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard.
This compatibility should not be interpreted as an arithmetic relation of equivalence, but as an
interpretation under a general analysis of the contents of both standards. This analysis includes
the minimum requirements set out in the articles of Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3 May and clauses
[requirements] of the ISO.
This guide aims to offer an agile tool for those entities that intend to enrich their security
framework associated with compliance with the National Security Framework, through the
deployment of an information security management system, with complementary sources of ISO
27002:2022 and even capable of supporting an ISO 27001 certification. For the integration of
management systems, it is always advisable to carry out a convergence analysis, so the work
initiated in this guide is only a general approach that should be particularised for each organisation.
This guide can also be used in reverse, i.e., for those entities that already have information
security management systems under ISO 27001 and wish to validate the compliance of their
systems with Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3 May.
3. SCOPE
This guide establishes general guidelines that are applicable to organisations of different
nature, size and sensitivity, without going into particular cases. It is expected that each
organisation will tailor them to suit its unique environment.
4. ISO STANDARDS
ISO15 is the International Organisation for Standardisation, which develops, through different
groups of experts16, international standards as frameworks of recognised prestige and which make
10 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
11 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
12 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to
the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
13 https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit
14 ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) and IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) constitute the specialised system for
worldwide standardisation.
15 https://www.iso.org/
16 The expert committees also have development agreements with other organisations such as IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission.

it possible to demonstrate the conformity of processes, products or services to previously
established requirements.
ISO enjoys international recognition and prestige, so that globally a system accredited under
this standard provides reliability. Thus, for an organisation, presenting an accreditation related to
an ISO standard means being able to demonstrate to any third party that it has independently
reviewed and verified effective compliance with ISO requirements. An ISO standard implies
reliability, which is why they are sometimes adopted by governments and control authorities as a
reference of solidity and normative reinforcement17, which helps to save time, costs and reduce
barriers in the international sphere.
And it is here where the importance of this Guide stands out, as a tool for analysing the security
measures compatible with the ISO/IEC 2700:2022 standard and the [legal] Royal Decree 311/2022,
of 3 May. In such a way that it allows entities that so consider, to take advantage of the synergies
of an information security management system under the umbrella of both18.
It is important to note at this point that the mere fact of having an ISO standard certificate does
not automatically lead to equivalence with other standards or frameworks. Entities must submit
their management systems to the accreditation and conformity processes required by each
framework or standard.
4.1. THE ISO/IEC 2700 SAGA 0
At a general level, there is a complete set of ISO 27000 standards, which encompass different
information security practices, elements or requirements that will help to deploy an adequate
information security system, and under the dimensions of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
Within the ISO 27000 family19, we can look at ISO 27000 itself, which describes the overview of
security systems and provides key vocabulary and definitions of information security management
systems.
They can also be good references for the family of information security management systems;
ISO/IEC 27003 (standard that provides guidelines for deploying an information security
management system with the "Plan, Do, Check, Act" improvement cycle).
ISO/IEC 27004 (standard that develops techniques related to metrics and indicators to measure
the effectiveness of an information security management system).
ISO/IEC 27005 (standard that includes methodologies for developing the information security
risk management process).
ISO /IEC 27017 (standard deploying controls for information security in the cloud)
ISO /IEC 27018 (standard deploying privacy controls for cloud services)
17 One can consider for example Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/127 of 7 December 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2021/2116
of the European Parliament and of the Council with rules on paying agencies and other bodies, financial management, clearance of accounts,
securities and the use of the euro (hereinafter Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2022/127), Annex I, 3 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION, point
(B), "The security of information systems shall be certified in accordance with ISO 27001: Information Security management systems - Requirements
(ISO) (ISO)."
18 Led under the [legal] framework of reference, as a compulsory rule for the subjects that fall under its scope of application.

ISO /IEC 27019 (standard related to energy-related process control systems)
ISO/IEC 27701 (standard that develops in parallel to ISO 27001, a Privacy Management System).
4.1.1. ISO/IEC 27001:2022
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international, certifiable information security standard that can be adopted
by organisations [public and private] on a voluntary basis. The standard itself is flexible and
modular, as its requirements are generic and intended to be applicable to all organisations,
regardless of type, size or nature.
The fact that the ISO standard sets out its "requirements"20 implies that the management
system developed under its umbrella is auditable and certifiable. Therefore, accredited
certification bodies, after a systematic and methodical audit process, may consider conformity
with the standard.
Let us not forget that the purpose of ISO is to provide the requirements for establishing,
implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management
system, which will be the one to undergo the certification process.
The information security management systems deployed under this standard seek to maintain
the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information through a risk management process.
The ISO/IEC 27001:2022 "Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection -
Information Security Management Systems - Requirements" has been taken into account for the
elaboration of this guide.21 Heir to ISO/IEC 27001:2013, it has been revised in its entirety,
considering certain adaptations and updates in its set of Clauses22 and in Annex A of controls.
In relation to the clauses, there have been minor modifications, which affect more the drafting
part or separation into sub-clauses, rather than significant changes.
Although it is true that specific aspects have been clarified, such as the monitoring and follow-
up of security objectives, in general, the requirements of the 2013 standard are maintained, with
minor changes.

Table. New controls Annex A ISO 27001:2022
As will be seen below, the new system of controls in Annex A presents a better comparison of
the controls compatible with Annex II of Royal Decree 311/2022 of 3 May, given that both
standards have taken into account the evolution in cybersecurity required to face new risks and
challenges.
4.1.2. ISO/IEC 27002
ISO/IEC 27002 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection - Information
Security Control is not a standard of requirements and therefore not certifiable. However, this
standard is a code of good practice for information security management and is undoubtedly
helpful in deploying information security management systems.
It is intended to serve as an orientation guide for deploying the controls contained in Annex A
of ISO 27001. It can also be used as a guidance and implementation document for commonly
accepted information security controls.
The standard includes an Annex A24, which presents five blocks of characteristics, with different
attributes that have been assigned to each of the 93 controls in Annex A of ISO 27001:2022.
These attributes should serve to differentiate and separate controls, based on their priority uses
and purposes. It allows specific searches and mapping of controls with their associated purposes,
key points or dimensions.
Each control is associated with all those attributes that correspond to and/or describe it:
a) Control Type The control type is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of when and
how the control modifies the risk with respect to the occurrence of an information security
incident. The values of the attribute consist of Preventive (the control aims to prevent the
occurrence of an information security incident), Detective (the control acts when an information
security incident occurs) and Corrective (the control acts after an information security incident
occurs).

(b) Safety properties or dimensions25
The information security dimensions are an attribute to view the controls from the perspective
of what characteristics of the information it will help to preserve. The attribute values are
Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
c) Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity concepts is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of associating
controls to cybersecurity concepts defined in the cybersecurity framework described in ISO/IEC TS
27110. The attribute values consist of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover.
d) Operational capabilities
Operational Capabilities is an attribute for viewing controls from the perspective of the
information security capabilities professional. The attribute values consist of Governance, Asset
Management, Information Protection, Human Resource Security, Physical Security, System and
Network Security, Application Security, Secure Configuration, Identity and Access Management,
Threat and Vulnerability Management, Continuity, Supplier Relationship Security, Legality and
Compliance, Information Security Event Management and Information Security Assurance.
e) Security domains
Security domains is an attribute to view controls from the perspective of four information
security domains: "Governance and Ecosystem" includes "Information Systems Security
Governance and Risk Management" and "Ecosystem Cybersecurity Management" (including
internal and external stakeholders); "Protection" includes "Information security architecture",
"Information security administration", "Identity and access management", "Information security
maintenance" and "Physical and environmental security"; "Defence" includes "Detection" and
"Information security incident management"; "Resilience" includes "Continuity of operations" and
"Crisis management". The attribute values consist of "Governance and ecosystem", "Protection",
"Defence" and "Resilience".
4.2 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ISO 27001 AND ENS
The good synergy and reciprocity between the National Security Framework [Royal Decree
311/2022 of 3 May] and ISO/IEC 27001:2022, and the possibility of deploying management
systems, considering the provisions of both frameworks, has already been highlighted. However,
it is also necessary to channel the particularities and differences between the two, without which
it will not be possible to maintain a system capable of complying with both.
At the national level, we cannot ignore the fact that according to article 2 of Royal Decree
311/2022, entities subject to compliance with the National Security Framework26, must deploy
management systems in accordance with it. However, these systems may contemplate the
25 This block can be assimilated to those of the National Security Framework, which also details the dimension(s) in which a security control takes
place. However, it should be noted that, for this standard, there are 5 dimensions as opposed to the three classic security dimensions considered
by ISO 27001.

Although, as can be seen, both standards have differences, they both share their key objective;
the management of risks associated with [cyber]security and consider not only the organisation
that owns the system, but also extend their requirements to suppliers and supply chains, including
those involved in cloud services, which are so common in our current environment.
The deployment of a management system, under the guidelines of these standards, will build
confidence with third parties, significantly improve the security and resilience of the system and
maintain the recognition of the services and products that are included under the scope of these
standards.
Finally, it is worth remembering that at the international level ISO can serve as a "unifying"
vehicle for security requirements, acting as a "translator" of security norms or standards. This is
reflected, for example, in the requirements imposed by the CAP [Common Agricultural Policy], or
in the standards associated with the financial sector, where it is common to make equivalences
between ISO/IEC 27001 and the authorities' own guidelines.
Therefore, working with compatible security measures of the National Security Framework and
ISO 27001 can be enriching and serve to evidence the requirements imposed in a uniform way and
under a common "language".
5. ENS COMPLIANCE THROUGH 27001 CERTIFICATION
An Information Security Management System is a set of policies, procedures and guidelines
established in an organisation, together with the resources and processes necessary to protect the
assets and especially the information asset. And this is precisely the objective of the National
Security Framework, which seeks to increase the security of services and information in the public
environment, in an organised manner and in which basic principles and minimum requirements
can be combined with technological measures and the necessary security governance.
Establishing and maintaining a management system is a strategic decision that will undoubtedly
benefit organisations. Selecting the appropriate standard or framework will depend on the
applicable regulations and often on the needs of the organisation, its objectives, internal processes
and the size and structure of the organisation.
The National Security Framework is a [legal] framework that is adapted to the environment,
which has considered the key points of [cyber]security, and which allows it to be aligned with other
security frameworks, including ISO 27001. However, certain differences between the two must be
taken into account, which will require adaptations to be made to the organisation's management
system.
If an entity develops the processes required by the standards, it will benefit from the
advantages of having an Information Security Management System that is legally compliant,
comprehensive, capable of evidencing security, and that fosters the ability to detect, react, recover
and learn from security incidents and events.
One of the advantages provided by the [legal] framework of the National Security Framework
is the efforts made by the Control Authority [CCN]. While it is true that ISO tends to publish
different support standards, such as ISO/IEC 27002, a more detailed and rapid analysis is needed,
capable of adapting to the needs of the moment, as is being developed within the scope of the
National Security Framework. And it is precisely the interest in improving the promotion and

development of security that has led to the constant publication of abstracts, reports, best
practices, compliance guides32 and cybersecurity solutions33, which make it possible to manage
key points, such as technological surveillance, data traceability or network visibility, in a more agile
and rapid manner than the ISO standard.
Another improvement that can be obtained by integrating the requirements of the National
Security Framework is the consideration of the five dimensions of security, which allows the
deployment of controls focused on the two dimensions not initially considered by ISO.
Generally speaking, when an entity is included in the scope of application of the National
Security Framework, it must include the conditions established therein in its management system.
This does not prevent it from integrating the rest of the points established by the ISO standard,
which allow security to be enhanced.
By working on the basis of a strategy in which the management system integrates the common
points of both frameworks and, at the same time, considers those where differences can be
included without hindering security, we can deploy an Information Security Management System
that supports both standards. In order to do so, we will need to consider:
A) Work with the five dimensions of security. Two dimensions should be included in addition
to the three classic ISO dimensions. This is not a security problem but can enrich the process
of attributes that Annex A of ISO/IEC 27002 has included in its 2022 version.
B) Analyse the scope of each standard and document each of them. A good strategy is to try
to unify the scopes where possible, so that the system can comprehensively cover both.
C) Unify statements of applicability, including and describing all applied controls, and giving
reasons for exceptions. The standards in their 2022 version have evolved and allow for good
compatibility of security measures.
D) Develop a single risk methodology to cover risk management and monitoring. Both
standards are permissive in terms of risk methodology, so the institution should adopt the
one that best fits its system and its assets.
E) Integrate security roles and management reviews. To include the requirements of both
standards, an annual [management] review report can be established, subject to its
presentation to the Information Security Committee, with the content required by ISO and
also covering those aspects that the National Security Framework establishes.
F) Consider an integrated management system, including all necessary processes, with the
records and documentary evidence required by both standards.
G) Analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of the management system, using metrics and
indicators to satisfy the analysis and monitoring requirements of both frameworks. At the
ISO level, it will be necessary to consider the organisation's security objectives and at the
Framework level, the required key indicators should be taken into account34.
H) Establish a review process, including annual audits against the requirements of both
standards. The process shall include the periodic safety reviews to be carried out.

I) To pass the certification processes35, taking into account the differentiated certification
Framework of each of the two standards, including the corresponding follow-ups, under the
complete cycle required by each standard.
One of the particularities of ISO is that only ISO/IEC 27001 is certifiable, as it is the standard that
includes the requirements. However, the organisation may consider not pursuing certification of
ISO/IEC 27001 or deploying ISO/IEC 27002 and enriching the system thanks to the security
contributions they provide. In any case, the organisation should carry out a cost-benefit analysis
and make the decision best suited to its needs.
5.1. ENS ROLL-OUT STRATEGY WITH ADAPTATIONS
The National Security Framework (ENS) is a [legal] framework, the result of national regulation
that is mandatory for the public sector and information systems of private sector entities when
they provide services or solutions to public sector entities for the exercise of their competences
and administrative powers, in accordance with the legal system. 36
The ENS requires a categorisation process (Annex I) and the deployment of a minimum set of
security measures (Annex II) based on it. Royal Decree 311/2002 of 3 May 2002 has introduced
novelties in relation to the applicability of the security measures contained in Annex II, from the
possibility given by Article 30 related to the publication of specific compliance profiles, to
mandatory or optional reinforcements differentiated by the level and category declared.
At a general level, the two standards [ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and Royal Decree 311/2022], have a
good Compatible Level, having followed a very similar evolution in relation to new risks,
considering the cloud environment and the possible dependence on suppliers.
Therefore, in order to achieve an integrated system with both standards, it is necessary to start
from the ENS category MEDIUM, with a concrete modulation based on:
A) Implementation of some HIGH category controls for improved deployment of the change
and business continuity process.
B) Implementation of category MEDIUM controls to the full extent, even if not provided for by
ISO 27001:2022.
It is important to maintain as a strategy, compliance with the ENS under the scope given by Law
40/2015, both from the point of view of essential assets (Annex I) and the components involved37.
Therefore, the scope must be aligned with legal compliance.
Furthermore, it should be noted that Annex II modulates the requirements according to the
categorisation of the system, whereas in ISO/IEC 27001 the level of requirements is limited to the
selected scope and motivation of the entity. It will therefore be necessary to consider the principle
35 The information systems subject to the application of the ENS shall be subject to a process to determine their compliance with the ENS, and to
this end, MEDIUM or HIGH category systems shall require an audit for the certification of their compliance, while BASIC category systems shall only
require a self-assessment for their declaration of compliance, without prejudice to the fact that they may also be subject to a certification audit,
for the purposes of the provisions of article 31 of Royal Decree 311/2022, section 2, "The audit shall be carried out according to the category of the
system and, where appropriate, the specific compliance profile that corresponds, in accordance with the provisions of Annexes I and III and in
accordance with the provisions of the Technical Security Instruction on Security Auditing of Information Systems".
36 Consider the provisions derived from Law 40/2015.
37 Note that a 27001 certification has whatever scope the organisation decides. It is sufficient that it is clearly delimited which part of the
management system is being certified.

of proportionality enshrined in the ENS, and to deploy the controls that, under the application of
the ENS, are necessary.
An initial map of compatible requirements is presented below, which is intended to help deploy
an integrated system for both frameworks.
It should be noted that the structuring of measures is not the same in the ENS as in 27001 and
27002. Some aspects are partially covered by some controls, and in most cases, ENS controls
require several ISO 27001 controls to be fully complied with.
Although it has already been mentioned, it is important to bear in mind that neither the
National Security Framework nor ISO/IEC 27001:2022 are aimed at business continuity, but that it
is part of the block of security measures that "can be deployed". Nevertheless, ISO has developed
a set of continuity standards, which include the requirements of a Business Continuity
Management System38.
5.2. SUMMARY TABLE
A global measures analysis has been carried out of both frameworks, both of their general part
(articles of the National Security Framework and Annex L of the ISO) and of the measures or
controls of Annex A of ISO 27001:2022 and Annex II of Royal Decree 311/2022, of 3 May.
It should be recalled that ISO/IEC 27001 is malleable39, whereas the ENS requires compliance
for the relevant dimensions and categories, so this should always be verified. 5.2.2. Analysis of
compatible requirements general part:
Below is a detailed comparison and analysis of the clauses of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 and Royal
Decree 311/2022 of 3 May, which must be considered in order to include the requirements given
in the management system.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | issues may include the political and economic situation, existing regulation, the state of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | technology, relationships with citizens and suppliers, the functions of any area or department |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | affected by the ISMS, the mission, vision and functions of the organisation, and in general, any |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | factor that impacts on its objectives and operations. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | The current ENS has taken into account the particularities of public entities and has considered |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | in its Article 30, the specific compliance profiles and accreditation of entities for the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | implementation of secure configurations. In this way, specific compliance profiles may be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | implemented for certain entities or sectors of activity, comprising the set of security measures |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | that, based on the mandatory risk analysis, are suitable for a specific security category. For the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ENS, when assessing these possible damages in the categorisation phase of the systems, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | organisations are carrying out an exercise of understanding their context. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | This categorisation is mandatory for all information systems within the scope of the ENS. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | However, the organisation should review whether it has a strategy in place where internal and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | external issues relevant to the ISMS are analysed on a regular basis in order to fulfil its mission |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | and objectives and to achieve further alignment with ISO 27001. |

CLAUSE Article / ENS Measure Analysis of compatible requirements and differences.
[op.pl.2] Security architecture or [op.exp.7.r2.2] Allocation of resources to investigate the causes, analyse the consequences
[op.mon.2] Metric system and resolve the incident. In general, the system deployed by ENS requires that the
[op.pl.4] Sizing / capacity management management system, related to the planning, organisation and control of information security
resources, is detailed in [op.pl.4] Sizing/capacity management. On this basis, it is necessary to
consider a forecast of the resources necessary to correspond to the two standards and
associated with measurements or monitoring to check their effectiveness, as proposed in
Reinforcement R1 - Effectiveness of the incident management system [op.mon.2.r1.1] and
Reinforcement R2 - Efficiency of the security management system [op.mon.2.r2.1].
For ISO, organisations must ensure that persons performing work that affects their information
security performance are competent, based on appropriate education, training or experience.
For the ENS, this requirement is present and is part of the articles, both in its initial part
"professionalism" and in its evolution from the point of view of periodic and specific training,
e Royal Decree 311/2022
especially in critical profiles for security functions. It should be noted that the qualification of
n c personnel is not only required internally, but also for the personnel of suppliers providing
e Article 15 Personnel management
e t security services to the organisation.
p Article 16 Professionalism
m Specifically, the ENS considers in control [mp.per.4] specific training of critical persons and
o Annex II

C
[mp.per.4] Training
functions, but further training requirements are also deployed in other controls. In addition,
7.
the effectiveness of the training actions carried out will be evaluated.
For example, it is stated in [op.pl.3.3] It shall consider technical, training and financing needs
together, [op.cont.2.4] The persons affected by the plan shall receive specific training related
to their role in the plan, [mp.per.1.2].
For ISO, it indicates that individuals should be aware of the information security policy, their
contribution to the effectiveness of the ISMS, as well as the implications of not complying with
s the requirements of the ISMS.
s Royal Decree 311/2022
e
n For the ENS, awareness is a basic security principle. The utmost attention shall be paid to the
e Article 6 Security as an integral process
a r awareness of the persons involved in the process and that of the hierarchy, in order to prevent
w Annex II
A ignorance, lack of organisation and coordination or lack of appropriate instructions from
3 [mp.per.3] Awareness raising
7. constituting sources of security risk. In addition, the security measure [mp.per.3] again requires
regular awareness-raising activities, in particular on security regulations and on the
identification and reporting of security incidents.
For ISO, organisations must determine the need for internal and external communications
related to the ISMS.
Royal Decree 311/2022
n For ENS, communications are associated with control points in the system, starting with the
o Article 25 Security incidents
a
ti
policy itself, communications to users and stakeholders, regulations, procedures.... and ending
c Annex II
ni with the point of contact associated with incidents or contingencies. This ensures that the

as well as to maintain the necessary evidence on the communications made regarding the
ISMS.
For ISO, it must include the documented information required by the standard, and that which
Royal Decree 311/2022 is determined to be necessary for the effectiveness of the ISMS. There must also be control

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | resources, is detailed in [op.pl.4] Sizing/capacity management. On this basis, it is necessary to |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | consider a forecast of the resources necessary to correspond to the two standards and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | associated with measurements or monitoring to check their effectiveness, as proposed in |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Reinforcement R1 - Effectiveness of the incident management system [op.mon.2.r1.1] and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Reinforcement R2 - Efficiency of the security management system [op.mon.2.r2.1]. |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | security performance are competent, based on appropriate education, training or experience. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For the ENS, this requirement is present and is part of the articles, both in its initial part |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | "professionalism" and in its evolution from the point of view of periodic and specific training, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | especially in critical profiles for security functions. It should be noted that the qualification of |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | personnel is not only required internally, but also for the personnel of suppliers providing |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | security services to the organisation. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Specifically, the ENS considers in control [mp.per.4] specific training of critical persons and |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | functions, but further training requirements are also deployed in other controls. In addition, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | the effectiveness of the training actions carried out will be evaluated. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For example, it is stated in [op.pl.3.3] It shall consider technical, training and financing needs |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | together, [op.cont.2.4] The persons affected by the plan shall receive specific training related |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | to their role in the plan, [mp.per.1.2]. |
|  |  | ess <br> n <br> e <br> ar <br> w <br> A <br> 3 <br> 7. |  | Royal Decree 311/2022 <br> Article 6 Security as an integral process <br> Annex II <br> [mp.per.3] Awareness raising |  |  |  |  | For ISO, it indicates that individuals should be aware of the information security policy, their |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | contribution to the effectiveness of the ISMS, as well as the implications of not complying with |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | the requirements of the ISMS. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For the ENS, awareness is a basic security principle. The utmost attention shall be paid to the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | awareness of the persons involved in the process and that of the hierarchy, in order to prevent |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ignorance, lack of organisation and coordination or lack of appropriate instructions from |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | constituting sources of security risk. In addition, the security measure [mp.per.3] again requires |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | regular awareness-raising activities, in particular on security regulations and on the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | identification and reporting of security incidents. |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | related to the ISMS. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For ENS, communications are associated with control points in the system, starting with the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | policy itself, communications to users and stakeholders, regulations, procedures.... and ending |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | with the point of contact associated with incidents or contingencies. This ensures that the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | system focuses on key communications. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Therefore, both standards must be aligned and it will be necessary to have a communications |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | tree associated to each required point of the ENS standard and which is fully integrated in ISO, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | as well as to maintain the necessary evidence on the communications made regarding the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ISMS. |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | over such documentation. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For the ENS, managing evidence and deploying the system in a documented manner is |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | important and is reflected in several points. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For example, article 12 itself or the policy [org.1] states that it includes guidelines for the |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | structuring of the system's security documentation, its management and access or article 28 |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | when it refers to the measures to be documented. The documentation required by security |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | architecture [op.pl.2], the security documentation associated with [op.acc], configuration |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | documents [op.exp.2], system interconnections [op.ext.4]. However, it does not clearly specify |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | the control of the overall documentary information process as the ISO guidelines should be |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | followed for both systems. |

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For ISO, the process of document creation and control is more restrictive, as it establishes |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | points associated with format and description. However, it shares approval with ENS. |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | For the ENS, security-related information considers precise points of creation and approval, |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | scattered throughout the articles and controls, such as [org.1] or [org.4]. |

It shall be approved by top management and shall set out the organisation's approach to
managing information security.
Consideration should be given to other policies that will complement this one, and where
appropriate the responsibility for the development, review and approval of specific policies by
relevant staff according to their level of authority and technical competence.
Recommendation Implementation:
Roles will be defined, and safety committee members will also perform functions for both
standards.
A lean and simple Governance Model is recommended, which considers the organisation's
strengths, its functional structure and clear separation, which facilitates the deployment of
security controls.
A Common Security Policy shall be drawn up, approved by the Committee and published in the
Official Journal.
[org.1.5] Guidelines for the structuring of system security documentation, its management and

Recommendation Implementation:
In general, there will be regulations on the use of equipment, services and facilities, and very
specifically, on improper use and, where appropriate, on liability for compliance or violation of the
regulations: (disciplinary measures).
To achieve synergy, it is necessary to include the mandates of both standards, with the
references to Clear Workplace [mp.eq.1], and the basic procedure/instruction for clearing
metadata [mp.info.5] can be included as an annex.
Security documentation shall be available, according to the applicable CCN-STIC guidelines.

Operating procedures for information processing actions should be documented and made
available to staff who need them.
Recommendation Implementation:
A minimum of operating procedures will need to be maintained. The organisation should
develop the necessary procedures associated with the system, specifying what, who and how to
do the operations, manage abnormal activities and information.
Organisations may have suppliers in charge of drawing up the procedures in which they may be
involved, and they may therefore be responsible for drawing up specific instructions, under the
supervision of the entity's Security Officer.
Information shall be managed in accordance with 7.5 Documented information of ISO
27001:2022.

Particularities of ISO:
While ISO is not as specific, it allows for the deployment of a particularised authorisation
process. The ENS mandate should therefore be prioritised over ISO.
Recommendation Implementation:
While ISO is not as specific, it allows for a particularised authorisation process to be deployed.
The entity must maintain an authorisation process, which identifies the different roles and
responsibilities, for key actions, including at least for the use of facilities, input of equipment and
applications in production, interconnections and communication links, use of MEDIUM and
information carriers.
Liability, related to system access, remote and handheld access, should also be considered.

It should be aligned with the change process. Consideration should be given not only to the ISO
control but also to Clause 6.3 Change planning, "Where the organisation determines the need for
changes to the information security management system, these changes shall be carried out in a
planned manner".
It is recommended to deploy a responsibility matrix to clearly identify existing roles and their
possible functions in relation to the assets and in the system.

o 6.1.3 - Dealing with information security risks
o 8.2 - Information security risk assessment
o 8.3 - Dealing with information security risks
Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
The criteria followed for risk acceptance, identifying risk owners, prioritising treatments and
assuming residual risks should be documented.
Recommendation Implementation:
Both standards converge and the same risk methodology can be used to deploy this control. At
least a semi-formal risk analysis will be necessary, using specific language, with a basic threat
catalogue and tabular presentation, considering qualitative assessments of the system's most
valuable assets, quantitative assessments of the most likely threats, assessment of safeguards and
assessment of residual risk.
The MAGERIT methodology using the PILAR tool is recommended. However, the ISO 31000
methodology can be used.
A declaration of shared applicability of both rules should be considered.
The Safety Committee shall approve the risks and the treatment plan and receive feedback on
risk management.
The Security Officer must approve the statement of applicability.

with capacity; formal process for planning the procurement of new system components,
considering capacity [op.pl.4], system risks [op.pl.1], architecture [op.pl.2] and technical, training
and funding needs.
This annual capacity plan shall consider forecasts, growth and security needs and resource
requirements. It shall be approved by the Information Security Committee.
In any case, entities should consider integration into their procurement processes and full
compliance with specific public procurement rules.

Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Planning, monitoring and adjustment. This management involves a dual strategy; increasing
capacity and/or reducing demand.
Recommendation Implementation:
The two standards can converge perfectly well. In general, a study should be available at least
annually, updated and monitored periodically. Different tools can be used to provide real-time
information on the status of capacity and alerts, to see trends for specific periods and to generate
alerts under defined thresholds. Automation is recommended, which can be through an ICT
provider to help manage measurements, alerts and planning.
Cloud services can be helpful, given their scalability. Consider control [op.nub.1].

Particularities of ISO:
There is no such control in ISO. However, it can be associated with assets, asset mapping and
the risks that may arise. Accredited products and services must be involved, under the premise of
improving security.

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
Recommendation Implementation:
This control is not contemplated in the ISO. It is necessary to include an inventory of the
components affected, analysing whether they comply with the established requirements, the
particularities provided for in Article 19 of the Royal Decree and specifically whether they are
components included in the STIC CCN 105 Catalogue. Where appropriate, similar European
accreditations, such as Common Criteria (EU), should be considered.
It is recommended that these requirements be integrated as requirements in the procurement
and contracting processes, such as future procurements of new components.
Where components are not listed in the relevant catalogue, other product or service
certifications, e.g. from the ISO 27000 family, can be associated.
[OP.ACC] ACCESS CONTROL
[op.acc.1] Identification
 Master Control ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 5.16 Identity management
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 5.15 Access control
Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
The full lifecycle of identities must be managed.
Recommendation Implementation:
Both standards allow for the management of identities in a comprehensive manner. To this end,
users must be identified with a unique identifier and can be aligned with the premises of the
standard.
When a user must have different roles in the system, he/she will receive different identifiers. It
is important that every entity (entity, user or process) has a unique identifier that allows to know
who acts [id] and the actions performed by each entity. In addition, accounts must be disabled for
loss of need and associated with the necessary withholdings. Withholdings must be considered
based on legal requirements.
Reinforcement R1 - Advanced identification will be considered; it will be possible to single out
the person, the associated privileges and a list of users will be maintained.
It is recommended that the entity keeps an inventory of services (including those provided by
cloud services) and associates the permissions granted. In this register, the identification
methodology can be controlled.
Records or traces can be traced through the active directory and the records and holds
associated with the activity records can be maintained.

o 8.2 Access Privilege Management
o 8.3 Restriction of access to information
o 8.18 Use of privileged utility programs
o 8.4 Access to source code
Category: HIGH *
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Rules for controlling physical and logical access to information and other associated assets
should be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements.
Various methods can be used for access control, and dynamic elements can be deployed.
Recommendation Implementation:
Access rights for each resource shall be established according to the decisions of the resource
manager, in compliance with the security policy and regulations of the system. Service
requirements and risk considerations should be the basis for defining access rights, tools and
granularity.
Access control rules can be implemented at different granularities, ranging from covering entire
networks or systems to specific data fields, and can also consider properties such as the location
of the user or the type of network connection used for access (will significantly affect costs and
resources).
In particular, the access to operating system components and their configuration files or
registers shall be controlled.
It is necessary to consider Strengthening R1 - Access Privileges, aligning both frameworks and
specifically control 8.2. Privileged access rights.
- op.acc.2.r1.1] All authorised users must have a set of security attributes (privileges) that can
be individually maintained.
- op.acc.2.r1.2] Access privileges shall be implemented to restrict the type of access a user may
have (read, write, modify, delete, etc.).

o 5.18 Access rights
o 8.2 Access Privilege Management
Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Duties and conflicting areas of responsibility should be segregated.
Recommendation Implementation:
The requirements of the MEDIUM category shall apply. Exceptionally, where entities are limited
in terms of "qualified" staff, compensatory measures for the requirement may be considered,
[op.acc.3.1] Where possible, development and operational capabilities should not be carried out
by the same person, and where segregation is difficult, other controls such as activity monitoring,
audit trails and management oversight may be considered.
An inventory of operations should be available, allowing differentiation of segregations and on
whom they fall. For example, in change issues; access rights, code and development, system in
production, applications, DB remote access…

o 5.18 Access rights
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.2 Access Privilege Management
Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Granting and revoking access rights. Review actions should be taken upon change or
termination of employment.
The allocation and use of privileged access rights must be restricted and managed.
Recommendation Implementation:
"Both standards converge, although in the case of ISO, provisions contained in several controls
must be considered.
Compliance with the principles of; "all access shall be prohibited unless expressly authorised";
"ability to authorise, with periodic review of permissions"; [org.4]"Minimal privilege to perform
duties or functions"; "need to know and responsibility to share"; and "specific remote access policy,
requiring express authorisation" shall be documented.
It is important to consider that this control affects all users, so third-party users must be
managed.

o 5.18 Access rights
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.5 Secure authentication
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Ensure that access rights are activated (e.g. by service providers) only after authorisation
procedures are successfully completed.
Recommendation Implementation:
This is a control that directly affects entities that are owners of published sites and services that
allow external users to access them. In this case, the ISO does not specify the control in detail,
although it does consider the requirements imposed by the ENS.
It is important to consider the Reinforcement R5 Register
[op.acc.5.r5.1] Successful and unsuccessful accesses shall be logged.
[op.acc.5.r5.2] The user shall be informed of the last access made with his identity.
Third parties may be involved and the responsibilities of the provider (developer and maintainer
of services) and the service holder should be considered.

Particularities of ISO:
Secure authentication technologies and procedures shall be implemented according to the
information access restrictions and the specific policy on access control.
Recommendation Implementation:
ISO control allows authentications to be adapted to ENS requirements, modulated with the

The system will only provide the information necessary for the user to authenticate, and if the
user is rejected, the reason for the rejection will not be given.
The number of attempts allowed shall be limited, and the user shall be informed of his rights or
obligations immediately after gaining access, as well as of the last access made with his identifier.
Accesses and attempts shall be logged.
Physical accesses to the facilities may be considered as accesses to controlled areas provided
that the requirement set out in the control [op.acc.6] is fulfilled. The controlled area shall be
considered as a differentiating element to require greater robustness in authentication:
a) Controlled area; considered as an area that is not publicly accessible and the user, before
having access to the equipment, has been authenticated in some way (facility access control), but
with a different mechanism than the logical authentication against the system.
b) Uncontrolled area, e.g. Internet. Reinforcement of the authentication process is required.
As authentication mechanisms in controlled areas, you can choose between:
(a) Password when access is from controlled areas and not through uncontrolled areas
b) Password and Other factor
(c) Certificate
Double factor for access from or through uncontrolled areas.
a) Password and Other factor
(b) Certificate
By default, a remote access policy shall be documented for authorised users and situations.
Remote access shall:
a) Be authorised.
b) Its traffic shall be encrypted.
c) To be disabled when not necessary, if the use is not constant.
d) Have audit trails of such connections.
The reinforcements (+R6) and (+R7) may be of interest based on the criticality of the
information it can process and aligns with the practices set out in ISO 27002.
Access from a provider may be authorised, access via tunnels, with source IP and prior access
control by the provider.
Finally, the reinforcements contained in the High category can be considered, as they can
improve access security and are covered by ISO 27002:
- end inactive sessions after a defined period of inactivity,
- restrict connection duration times to provide additional security for high-risk applications and
reduce the window of opportunity for unauthorised access.
There will be many remote or cloud-based services that can be derived as procedures, password
authentication and second factor authentication.

o 5.11 Return of assets
o 7.8 Siting and protection of equipment
o 7.9 Security of off-site assets
Category: MEDIUM (+R4)
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
An inventory of information and other associated assets should be developed and maintained,
including their owners.
Recommendation Implementation:
The BASIC category requirements apply. It should be recommended to consider the
reinforcements present in this control, which although not directly applicable may help to manage
the assets in a more complete way. As an example, see "Enforcement R4-List of software
components". [op.exp.1.r4.1] A formal list of third party software components used in the
deployment of the system shall be kept up to date. This list shall include software libraries and the
services required for their deployment (platform or operational environment). The content of the
list of components shall be analogous to that required in [mp.sw.1.r5].
It is important to manage asset inventories, which can be simple tools or more complex
depending on the volume of assets and the organisation's budget. Ideally, however, the inventory
should be traceable to key points such as security incidents or change management.
Consideration should be given to the owner of the asset, and specifically [mp.eq.3.1] inventory
of portable equipment together with an identification of the person responsible for it and a regular
check that it is positively under their control.
Inventories should ensure that they are kept up to date, so periodic reviews should be carried
out; and an update should be automatically applied after the process of installing, changing or
removing an asset.
The location of an asset should be included in the inventory as appropriate.
It should be noted that this inventory will assist in the case of both standards, risk management,
audit activities, vulnerability management and contingency and recovery planning.
Finally, it may enrich the inventory information to include the corresponding control
information [op.pl.5].

physical machines are managed.
Many functions may be managed by the service provider, who will consider the necessary
security requirements and specifically, those CCN- STIC guidelines41 and/or CCN tools that may be
useful. The system documentation will consider basing guidelines and documentation of those
tools that help to manage possible deviations or vulnerabilities. ENS requirements should be
deployed in order to maintain an appropriate configuration.
Because of the area of exposure, assets that are only in-house and do not present significant
risks may be configured with a generic security template, lowering certain security requirements.

Recommendation Implementation:
The organisation should define and implement processes and tools to enforce configuration. In
addition to maintaining a set of standard templates for hardware, software, services and network
security configuration, they should be periodically reviewed and, where necessary, updated. The
need to enforce security configuration should be defined and implemented in processes and tools.

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
The ENS is stricter in its requirements, and the application of this control is recommended in its
HIGH category, although it can be considered in its MEDIUM category. Compatibility can be
achieved through the controls identified and deployed in the system:
1.- Internal procedure for the identification of vulnerabilities in its products and services,
considering the asset inventory as a prerequisite, the software supplier, the roles and
responsibilities associated with vulnerability management, monitoring, risk assessment -
vulnerabilities, updating, tracking and notification, access and disclosure of vulnerabilities
including the requirements in the applicable supplier, support and licensing contracts.
An effective process for technical vulnerability management should be aligned with incident
management, to communicate vulnerability data to incident response and provide technical
procedures to be carried out in case an incident occurs.
Vulnerability scanning tools, penetration tests or vulnerability assessments by competent and
authorised persons can be used.
3.- The organisation should receive vulnerability reports from internal or external sources;
analyse and verify them; develop solutions (updates or patches); test and deploy in production.
4.- In the case of cloud services, part or even all of the responsibility for managing technical
vulnerabilities of their services is shifted to the provider, and processes for reporting actions to
customers will be included.
5.- Change management cannot be isolated in either standard, and the change management
cycle itself can be leveraged. 6. If adequate testing of updates is not possible, e.g. due to cost or
lack of resources, consideration can be given to delaying deployment to assess the associated risks.
7.- Penetration testing is also a method to identify vulnerabilities.
8.- When software patches or updates occur, the organisation may consider providing an
automated update process in which these updates are installed on affected systems or products
without the need for end-user intervention.

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
In general, both standards require us to have a documented process that will include planning
and assessment of the potential impact of changes, communications to stakeholders, testing (in
controlled environments) and acceptance of functional and security testing and authorisation of
changes.
The requirements of category HIGH shall apply. It is necessary to associate "Reinforcement R1-
Failure prevention" with the control [op.exp.4].
It is undeniable that there will be situations requiring emergency and contingency changes,
which will be the exception to the process but which will require a full security review afterwards.

Particularities of ISO:
Protection against malware must be implemented, including user awareness actions.
Recommendation Implementation:
Both standards converge perfectly, although it is necessary for control to be led by the ENS
requirements for the MEDIUM category. This will provide solutions for detecting malicious code
on all equipment and devices in the system, updating databases and analysing any external files.
The solution will analyse the systems at start-up.
We must consider the impact of this control on control [op.exp.4] Maintenance and continuity

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Security incident management will be carried out, defining and establishing a process, with the
roles involved and responsibilities.
Recommendation Implementation:
In the case of ISO, there are several controls to be considered in order to meet the requirements
of the ENS in its MEDIUM category. 5.24 Information security incident management planning and
preparation, 5.25 Assessment and decision on information security events, 5.26 Information
security incident response, 5.27 Learning from information security incidents.
It is desirable that entities tend to comply with the requirements as detailed in the ENS, given
that the Royal Decree is aligned with European regulations and outlines the cybersecurity strategy.
Consideration should be given to deploying a process that will be aligned with the CCN-STIC Guide
817 and the National Cyber Incident Guide and work under the single window, the LUCIA platform
(Strengthening R1 - Notification [op.exp.7.r1.1] public sector entities).
The entity shall develop a comprehensive process for dealing with security incidents, including
classification criteria and escalation of notification. A process for the reporting of lost or stolen
devices and laptops [mp.eq.3.2] shall be included and the necessary measures and sufficient
resources for incident management shall be deployed.
[op.exp.8] Logging of user activity
 Master Control ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.15 Event registration
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.17 Clock synchronisation
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Logs of activities, exceptions, failures, faults and other relevant events must be activated,
protected, stored and analysed.
Recommendation Implementation:
The ENS standard is stricter in terms of requirements than ISO, but the latter allows the process
to be deployed with the security points we need. Thus, an audit log will be kept operational, which
will include at least the user or entity identifier, date and time, what information is affected, type
of event (*) and its result (failure or success). It is necessary to activate the logs on the servers.
An informal review process shall be maintained, maintaining strict control over access to
records and their configuration; clock synchronisation shall be maintained for evidence of
recording; and a register or inventory shall be prepared with operational records, third parties
involved and retention times established.

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
With regard to events (*), they should be considered [recommended]:
a) User and administrator authentication events (including access control system alerts and
successful and failed logins).
b) Events of actions performed on files and objects.
c) Upload and download events.
(d) events of actions on user accounts (including creation, modification or deletion of rights or
identities)
e) Events of actions performed by privileged users.
f) All additional events reflected in the different security policies (including changes in system
configuration; use of utility programs and other applications; activation and deactivation of
protection systems, such as anti-virus systems and intrusion detection systems).
While it is not necessary to automate the review process for the MEDIUM category, it is
advisable to have a security information and event management (SIEM) tool or an analogous
service to store, correlate, normalise and analyse log information and generate alerts.
SIEMs tend to require careful configuration to optimise their benefits. Settings to consider
include identifying and selecting appropriate logging sources, tuning and testing rules, and
developing use cases.
Cloud services should maintain their own activity logging and alert management service.
It is recommended that, if you are analysing solutions on the market that cover the ENS
requirements, you take into account that these are listed in CCN-STIC-105 ICT Security Products
and Services Catalogue 7.2.6 FAMILY: SECURITY EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS".

CCN-STIC-825 CCN-STIC 825 ENS - Certifications 27001
Recommendation Implementation:
On a general level ISO is flexible in deploying ENS requirements. All actions derived from
[op.exp.7] must be documented. The Register may be managed by a manual file, but it must be
mapped to the requirements set out in CCN STIC Guide 817 and, where access is available, the
LUCIA solution itself.
Evidence will be managed for use in any jurisdictional setting, (disciplinary purposes and/or
diversion of external suppliers and/or prosecution of crime).
There shall be analysis of incidents and identification of auditable events [op.exp.8].
To facilitate the recording of accurate information, the use of incident forms is recommended
to assist staff in collecting all necessary information.
For the purposes of the ENS, there will be feedback processes with other entities and, based on
this information, it will be possible to report the necessary information security events. It is
interesting for the organisation to receive regular information on the global trend of incidents and
attacks, both within the organisation's sphere of activity and in its own area of activity. This can
help the entity to calibrate prevention measures and even train and raise awareness among its
users.
[op.exp.10] Cryptographic key protection
 Master Control ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.24 Use of cryptography
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 5.17 Authentication Information
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, must be
defined and implemented.
The level of protection required derives from the classification of the information itself both for
the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithm required.
The organisation shall determine the standards to be adopted, as well as the cryptographic
algorithms, encryption strength and usage practices, for effective implementation throughout the
organisation (which solution is used for which processes). The ICT Security Guide CCN-STIC 807
shall be taken into account.
Recommendation Implementation:
ISO itself derives from legal requirements, in the fulfilment of this control. In order to
implement the organisation's rules for the effective use of cryptography, account must be taken
of legislation and restrictions that may apply to the use of cryptographic techniques and the
problems of encrypted information transmissions.
It is therefore necessary for the NSS to lead the requirements.

At the ENS level, not only the management of security requirements is required, but also the
management of service levels and availability, which can have a very direct impact on continuity
and service. Service Level Agreements should be included as a requirement in contracts (and
specifically in tenders), as well as the characteristics of the "minimum acceptable service", the
liability and consequences of non-compliance. Other affected controls [op.cont] and [op.pl.3]

It is appropriate to consider the requirement of the provision contained in Article 2 of Royal
Decree 311/2022 of 3 May;
"The administrative or technical specifications for contracts entered into by public sector entities
(...) shall include all those requirements necessary to ensure compliance with the ENS (...)".
This caution shall also extend to the supply chain of such contractors, to the extent necessary
and in accordance with the results of the relevant risk analysis.
In the entity's risk analysis, services and outsourcing should be considered, irrespective of the
methodology used.
The legal requirements involved must be considered.
Suppliers should be required to propagate security requirements throughout the supply chain

and criticalities must be considered, allowing RTOs and RPOs to be detected.
It is recommended that identified risks (output of the risk analysis [op.pl.1]), which have the
particularity of having a high impact and low probability, be analysed. These risks can be
considered as scenarios associated with disruptions and should be used to assist in the preparation
of contingency situations.

National Security Framework and ISO 27001, the controls associated with continuity and
alternativity must be promoted.
A comprehensive plan must be designed that necessarily includes the entity's contingency
strategy, information, systems, assets, personnel, facilities, collaborators and support tools. It is
necessary to plan and maintain preparedness for the hypothetical materialisation of a catastrophic
event.
Within the organisation's strategy, consideration should be given to those security controls that
will not operate during a total outage or shutdown of the organisation, and where appropriate, to
propose compensating controls for those information security controls that cannot be maintained
during the outage. A good strategy for this may be to consider an applicability statement with
complementary sources to ISO 27001 and the ENS, identifying those controls that will be
temporarily disabled and those that will be temporarily enabled as an alternative or compensatory
measure. ".

Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
ICT preparedness should be planned, implemented, maintained and tested against business
continuity objectives and ICT continuity requirements.
Recommendation Implementation:
This control shall be included as a HIGH category control. As part of the continuity strategy, the
entity should analyse the most appropriate tests to check that its planning is correct and that the
estimated resources are sufficient. The need for ICT preparedness for business continuity can be
enriched by also considering identified high impact, low probability risks.
The entity should establish a test plan, with schedules and responsible persons, and document
the results for detailed analysis and study. Different modalities and different perspectives can be
considered for testing, both mock and paper tests.
Planning should include all types of scenarios, including those with high impact and low
probability, often called extreme but plausible scenarios. It is important to consider the continuity
tests associated with the most critical services, plot timelines and analyse deviations.

Recommendation Implementation:
In order to have a management system aligned with the two standards, this HIGH category
control shall be included. The scope of the control can be aligned to the main ISO requirement,
but in any case, the organisation must align its capacity plan [op.pl.4] with this control, given that
there are (classic) contingency scenarios associated with "unavailability" of key resources on a day-

It is recommended that the organisation design and implement a system architecture with
adequate redundancy to meet these requirements.
Cloud services enable compliance with this control, provided they are considered as an
alternative or contracted with the key redundancy service.

information security management system. The organisation shall determine who, when, what, and
how, should be monitored.
Metrics can be used for both systems, but for ISO purposes, they must include the monitoring
of safety targets.
Recommendation Implementation:
The ENS criteria should be imposed to compile the required metrics, taking into account what
is indicated in the ICT Security Guide CCN-STIC 817. The entity should maintain a measurement
related to the degree of implementation of security measures and, where appropriate, in those
public entities should make the annual report on the state of security, using the INES platform. In
addition, it is advisable to take into account the measurements of maturity levels and
implementation levels in accordance with CCN-STIC Guide 808.
Measurements derived from [op.exp.9] and analysis of resources, hours and budget for security
are considered.
The entity could deploy in the system a catalogue of general metrics associated with a
Statement of Applicability and extend measurements to ISO security controls and objectives,
considering Clause 6.2 Information security objectives and planning for their achievement; these
should be measurable (if possible). To achieve compatible measures, appropriate security
objectives and metrics should be considered.

Particularities of ISO:
Information related to security threats will be collected and analysed to generate information.
Recommendation Implementation:
An automatic system for collecting and correlating security events, services/architecture will be
available. This service may be developed directly by the entity or it may be contracted to a third
party. Sometimes cloud services will include this service as an added element.
The entity shall also have monitoring solutions in place to determine the exposure surface in
relation to vulnerabilities and configuration deficiencies. This security functionality may also be an
outsourced service managed by a third party. These monitoring solutions shall allow the
determination of the exposure surface in relation to vulnerabilities and configuration deficiencies.
It is advisable to consult the solutions of the CCN and in any case to consider CVE analysis through
official sources and lists. The organisation could consider vulnerability warnings and consider them
for risk analysis and analyse the impacts derived from them. In any case, it is advisable to maintain
a broad system of sources, through information provided by different agents, such as suppliers or
independent advisors, control authorities or threat intelligence expert groups.
A significant element to consider is the format available for system logs and events, so that they
can be stored in a standardised format, which can be exploited by correlators or syslog.
Entities can consult the different tools available in the CCN for the management of this control.
For ISO we talk about threat intelligence and requires connection to controls 5.25 Information
security event assessment and decision, 8.7 Controls against malicious code, 8.8 Technical

the entity has outsourced housing/hosting services to a third party, or because it is working with
cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) or because the infrastructure itself depends on another entity.
Entities must analyse the impact of control and maintain the requirements of both standards. In
any case, security measures should be considered as extending to data processing centres and
communications or interconnection rooms. Compliance should be considered for own
infrastructure and, where appropriate, require providers and cloud services to comply with these.
In any case, services contracted from a provider will involve these measures, which will be required

offices and resources; 7.8 Siting and protection of equipment; 7.12 Security of cabling; 7.13
Security of equipment; 7.14 Security of equipment.
Thus control 7.8 Site equipment protection refers to the need to deploy controls to minimise
the risk from potential physical and environmental hazards; for example, theft, fire, explosives,
smoke, water or water supply failure, dust, vibration, chemical effects, power supply interference,
communications interference, electromagnetic radiation and vandalism; or risks arising from
environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, which should be monitored to

be proportionate to the organisation's objectives, the classification of information being accessed
and the perceived risks.
This control should be complemented by Terms and Conditions of Engagement.
Recommendation Implementation:
The two standards work in tandem, bearing in mind that the ISO requirement may not be
applicable to the full extent where there are previous personnel processes [public sector post
provisioning] that have already collated the information to be verified. Verifications of suitability
for the post and competence in relation to that required to perform the security function that may
be involved, and especially confidentiality, should be considered.
At the ENS level, it does not go into assessing the background of users to the system, beyond
those referring to security needs. It is important to establish an allocation of human resources
(appropriate and trained) in consideration of [op.pl.4], with a clear separation of functions
(consider the controls [org.4] and [op.acc.3]), as well as the definition of attributions (and
especially for the public sector, through the corresponding RPT administrative processes).

Organisations should have a plan in place, including plans for innovative actions to raise
awareness. Different means of delivery can be used, including online classroom or webinar based,
web-based information, and others.
Technical staff should keep their knowledge up to date by subscribing to newsletters and
journals or attending conferences and events aimed at technical and professional improvement.
**The awareness-raising programme should include a range of activities through appropriate
channels, such as campaigns, brochures, posters, newsletters, websites, briefings, learning
modules and e-mails.
Staff understanding should be assessed at the end of an awareness-raising activity. These
evaluations should consider not only the user's view, but also the view of managers and security-
relevant persons. The evolution of awareness should be considered, using certain metrics and
indicators.
The CCN regularly updates documents and seminars, and includes its tools (e.g. ELENA and

The effectiveness of the training actions carried out will be evaluated.
An annual training plan should be developed, including the planned actions. Training actions
can take different forms and have different agendas. The CCN has tools that can help with this and
so do other security authorities (INCIBE, ENISA...). Training actions can be used, which are present
on the CCN's platforms, such as VANESA, for example.

Recommendation Implementation:
The two rules are clearly synergistic, so that the protection of information (especially
information that must be kept confidential or is considered sensitive or critical due to the functions
performed, in any case considering control [mp.info.2]) must be considered.
Workstations shall remain uncluttered, keeping in use only such information as is always
necessary, and which shall be stored in a secure location whenever possible.
Consideration should be given to the security of information on paper or on Storage media such
as USB or similar, and should seek to archive it in places with operational locks, under lock and key
(safe, cabinet or filing cabinet or other security furniture) when the need for its use has ceased
and when control over it cannot be maintained (e.g. absences or the office is unoccupied).
This measure should be aligned with [org.2] and 5.10 Acceptable use of information and

Category: MEDIUM
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Clear rules for desk, paper and storage and/or removable media, as well as clear rules for clean
screens on the organisation's premises should be defined and enforced.
Recommendation Implementation:
At the level of both standards, at least the MEDIUM category will be considered. This necessarily
implies to draw technical measures for equipment and devices and services to be disconnected or
protected with a locking mechanism, controlled by a password, token or user authentication
mechanism. All equipment and devices and services must be configured with an automatic time-
out or log-off function.
At the very least, this policy should be deployed in the directory and deployed from the initial
basing of the component [op.exp.2], with a Technical Instruction [org.3] developing it, and the
effectiveness will be checked from time to time [op.exp.3].
For example, the application on the equipment can be checked from time to time by means of
CLARA.
SaaS services should deploy this measure in identical terms, so providers should be required to
do so and to check its applicability.
Users should in any case be aware of the need to lock sessions on computers, devices and
services when they leave the workstation, even if only for a limited period of time.
Based on the risks detected, it may be advisable to deploy the R1-Session Closure Enforcement.

The organisation should establish a specific policy on the management of removable media and
communicate that policy to anyone using or handling removable media, require authorisation for
the media and maintain a record. The media should be stored in a secure and protected
environment in accordance with the rating of the information and protected against
environmental threats (such as heat, humidity, electronic field or ageing) in accordance with
manufacturers' specifications.
Physical and logical measures will be deployed to prevent misuse.
It is possible that storage may be established in fireproof boxes, so they must be traced with
the manufacturer's indications and the conservation point that allows them to withstand fire.
The manufacturer's instructions on temperature and humidity must be taken into consideration
and the corresponding data sheets [org.3] and 7.13 Maintenance of equipment (Equipment shall
be properly maintained to ensure the availability, integrity and confidentiality of information.)
It is advisable to take into account the best practices described in ISO 27002, as they can enrich
compliance with this control. For example, all media should be stored in a secure and protected
environment according to their information classification and protected against environmental
threats (such as heat, humidity, electronic field or ageing), according to manufacturers'
specifications; to mitigate the risk of media degradation while the stored information is still
needed, information should be transferred to new media before it becomes unreadable.

Level of measures Compatible: Nil
Particularities of ISO:
This is not a specific ISO control, but we associate it with certain controls, considering
cryptographic elements. When a trusted authority is used (e.g. for the purpose of issuing and
maintaining digital signatures or certificates), security is embedded in the whole end-to-end
signature or certificate management process.
Recommendation Implementation:
ISO does not consider this control, but it can be associated with controls 8.26 and 8.24. The
measure is considered to be complied with when any signature valid in the current regulations is
used. Controls on the same and the acceptable use must be managed.
It is important to consider the following reinforcements:
Reinforcement R1 - Qualified certificates: When advanced electronic signatures based on
certificates are used, these shall be qualified. Qualified providers will be those who issue them, in
accordance with the European regulations in force.
Strengthening R2 - Authorised algorithms and parameters: The CCN shall determine the
cryptographic algorithms that have been authorised.
Reinforcement R3 - Signature verification and validation: Verification and validation of the
signature shall be ensured for the required time.
A policy should be deployed or attached to that of the higher administrative body. It is
important that the custody and use of the signature is managed. In this regard, special
consideration will be given to cloud services and specific agreements with other public entities or
third parties may need to be deployed. HSM services may be deployed, which should be ENS-
compliant.
It should consider the processes in which signature verification must be maintained and
therefore deploy preservation environments that allow for such verification. These environments
can be in an in-house or third-party service.
Certified components can be taken into account by direct application of control [op.pl.5].

This is not a specific ISO control, but we associate it with certain controls. We consider
cryptographic elements and specifically the synchronisation of clocks and time accreditation of
events.
Recommendation Implementation:
This control has the particularity of not being present in the case of ISO and of not being
required in those entities whose category is MEDIUM. However, in the event that the entity has
declared a HIGH category or the application of the control has been considered (especially for the
purposes of the administrative procedures involved), this control will be considered.
Time stamps shall be renewed regularly until the protected information is no longer required
by the administrative process it supports.
- mp.info.4.4] "Qualified electronic time stamps" shall be used in accordance with Regulation
(EU) No 910/2014.
Complementary consideration shall be given to site/website certificates, which must be issued
by qualified entities in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014.
[mp.info.5] Cleaning of documents
 Master Control ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o It is not envisaged
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 5.13 Labelling of information
o 8.12 Preventing data leakage
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Nil
Particularities of ISO:
This control is not explicitly covered by the standard but can be considered in the derived
control of labelling of digital documents and the use of metadata for this purpose.
Recommendation Implementation:
This control is connected to control [org.2] and [mp.si.1] and [mp.info.2]. It is important to
deploy a metadata policy for the control of information that will be actively incorporated into the
entity's processes. Information that needs to be removed, prior to publication/dissemination,
should be "processed" to remove unnecessary metadata.
Training and awareness-raising actions shall be maintained for the purposes of [mp.per.3] and
[mp.per.4].
Although ISO does not expressly contemplate control, there are references to metadata
management in control 5.13 and as best practices they can complement the provisions of ENS.

Category: MEDIUM (+R2) *
Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Backups will cover information, software, configuration and overall systems should be
maintained and tested regularly in accordance with the agreed subject-specific backup policy.
Recommendation Implementation:
For ISO purposes there is a compatible level of security measures as the operational control
8.13, aligns with the [mp.info.6].
The MEDIUM category shall apply, together with the requirements of "R2 Hardening-Protection
of backups". [mp.info.6.r2.1] At least one of the backup copies shall be stored separately in a
different location so that an incident cannot affect both the original repository and the copy
simultaneously.
o Reinforcement R2-Protection of backups is considered, for critical items that require
storage in a different location. This shall be associated with the results of the assessment
derived from [mp.info.2] and the risks [op.pl.1] and impact [op.cont.1] and consideration
of 8.14 Redundancy of information processing facilities and 5.31 Identification of legal,
regulatory and contractual requirements.
This control shall be referenced to "R3-Backup R3.1. [op.exp.3.r3.1] The configuration of the
system shall be backed up in such a way that it is possible to rebuild part or all of the system after
an incident.
It is important to note that this control is associated with continuity and for ISO this is
significant, as it must be taken into account in order to comply with ISO requirements. It is
necessary to establish a backup policy that considers the organisation's information security and
data retention requirements. Consideration should be given to backup facilities for information
and software. The copying process and its timing and retention shall be aligned with legal
requirements and the personal information it contains.
Information related to the whole copying process must be controlled, including software used,
processes, revisions... A protocol [org.3] for simple restores should be available and can be aligned
with the control [op.cont.3] and considered as continuity testing.

o 5.23 Information security for use of cloud services
o 6.2 Terms and conditions of engagement
o 6.3 Information security awareness, education and training
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Information transfer rules, procedures or agreements should be in place, both within the
organisation and between the organisation and other parties, for all types of information transfer.
Recommendation Implementation:
For ISO this is mainly about information exchange or transfer, as well as electronic means, which
is where the mail service is included. This control may be delegated to the mail provider and
control [org.2] shall be considered for the specification of instructions for use.
This monitoring will consider guidelines related to more means of information transmission (not
only e-mail, but other means, including physical means and verbal transmission) that will enrich
the ENS security guidelines.
Consider social engineering actions that can help raise awareness [mp.per.3].

o 8.5 Secure authentication
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Information security requirements should be identified, specified and approved when
developing or acquiring applications.
Recommendation Implementation:
By default, all published services will consider access controls (where required), protections
against tampering and code injection attacks, privilege escalation and cross site scripting.
An audit plan should be in place that provides for the actions of automatic vulnerability reviews,
similar tools and black box/white box audits.
It is common to deploy services through a service provider (specific services or web services). It
is recommended to include in contracts and tender conditions the requirement for the execution
of the analysis and the action plans resulting from the analysis.
Services contracted to third parties shall contain the measures required in this control and
specifically the obligation to correct vulnerabilities detected in the platforms through security
scans.
At least one annual black box test with a report and action plan shall be required. The audit plan
shall reflect the estimated dates of execution of the audits and the reference of the entity (public
or private) in charge of the audit.
There is no level of compatible measures with respect to the requirements set by the standards
since the ENS is rigorous and specific. ISO, however, allows to deploy these requirements and to
adjust the system and the statement of applicability for harmony.
It will be mapped against the audit and review plan and linked to the management of action
plans arising from the security of web applications / published items.
Applications accessible over networks are subject to a variety of threats, therefore security
requirements scattered throughout the ISO will be considered, such as access management
through authentication (see 5.17, 8.2, 8.5); resilience against malicious attacks or unintentional
disruptions (e.g. buffer overflow protection or SQL injections).

Compatible measurement level: Analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Access to external websites should be managed to reduce exposure to malicious content.
Recommendation Implementation:
The two standards are closely aligned in this control.
Rules of use and limitations of personal use shall be established [org.2]. Awareness-raising
activities [mp.per.3] will be carried out regularly, on hygiene in web browsing, encouraging safe
use and warning of incorrect use, by means of informative mailings, posters or session banners.
Training [mp.per.4] shall be provided to system administration, service monitoring and incident
response personnel.
Measures shall be deployed to protect web address resolution and connection establishment
information from malicious software and a cookie control policy shall be in place, in particular to
avoid contamination between personal and organisational use and shall be made known to users
through awareness actions [mp.per.3]. Web filtering may include a variety of techniques including
signatures, list of acceptable websites or domains, list of banned websites or domains, and custom
configuration to help prevent software and other malicious activities from affecting the
organisation's network and systems. Actions such as automatic blocking should be considered.
Browser configurations according to [op.exp.2] and [op.exp.3] should be considered.

o 8.6 Capacity Management
 Complementary Controls ISO/IEC 27001:2022
o 8.16 Monitoring of activities
Category: MEDIUM
Level of measures Compatible: Partially analogue
Particularities of ISO:
Resource use should be monitored and adjusted according to current and expected capacity
requirements.
Recommendation Implementation:
Forecasting analyses shall be performed in the annual capacity plan [op.pl4], with a special
emphasis on needs analysis, and tools shall be deployed to monitor system behaviour, whereby
trends can be extracted and adaptations can be made according to the needs presented. Detection
controls should be put in place to indicate problems in a timely manner.
Network management services will be considered, through firewall services and appropriate
configuration to consider this type of DoS incidents. Tools to assist in the prevention of such
incidents will be considered in addition to managed services.

It is desirable to review and include as a requirement in supply contracts / solutions and denial
of service management.
Cloud services have these measures embedded in them, as their services will be properly
protected and balanced in case of need. [op.nub.1]
It would be a good alternative measure to consider cloud services with deployment of measures
associated with capacity and availability (Cloud services are characterised by elasticity and
scalability that allow for rapid expansion and reduction on demand of available resources for
particular applications and services, which is useful for reducing the demand on organisational
resources).
7. OTHER CONTROLS OF THE ISO
As can be seen, it is necessary in some cases to deploy several ISO controls in order to provide
full coverage of the requirement established in the ENS. However, there are some of them, which
have not been included because they have less impact.
Some ISO controls have been highlighted here, as an exemplification of their consideration
within some aspect of Royal Decree 311/2022.
5.4 Management responsibilities
Top management should ensure that all employees and contractors are aware of and follow
the organisation's information security policy.
Consideration in the CSA:
Article 13. Organisation and implementation of the security process.
org.1 Security policy
5.5 Contact with the authorities
It should be clear who is responsible for contacting authorities (e.g. law enforcement agencies,
regulators, supervisory authorities), which authorities should be contacted (e.g. which
region/country) and in which cases this is necessary. A rapid and appropriate response to incidents
can greatly lessen the impact and may even be required by law.
Consideration in the CSA:
Article 25. Security incidents.
op.exp.7 Incident management
5.6 Contact with special interest groups
To ensure that the latest information security trends and best practices are maintained, staff
with ISMS tasks should maintain good contact with special interest groups. These groups can be
asked for expert advice in certain cases and can be a great source for improving one's own
knowledge.

5.11 Return of assets
When an employee or outsider can no longer access an asset, e.g. at the end of the contract,
the asset must be returned to the organisation. There should be a clear policy for this, which should
be known to all involved.
Consideration in the CSA:
org.2 Safety regulations
5.17 Authentication information
Secret authentication, such as passwords and access keys, should be managed in a formal
process. In addition, among other security actions, users should be prohibited from sharing secret
authentication information.
Consideration in the CSA:
op.acc.1 Identification
op.acc.2 Access requirements
5.32 Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
Intellectual property rights are also part of legal compliance. Intellectual property can be of
great value. Misuse can result in great harm and loss.
Consideration in the CSA:
org.1 Security policy
op.exp.1 Inventory of assets
org.2 Safety regulations
5.33 Protection of registers
All records must be protected. Records have the added risk of loss, compromise or unauthorised
access. Requirements for the protection of records may come from the organisation itself or from
other sources, such as legislation. For this, strict guidelines must be created and followed.
Consideration in the ENS
op.exp.8 Registration of the activity
op.mon.3 Surveillance
5.35 Independent Review of Information Security
It is not recommended that organisations review their own information security system. It is
therefore advisable to have independent reviews, so that their information security is audited
periodically or when significant changes occur. This maintains an objective and transparent view
of information security.
Consideration in the ENS
Article 31. Safety audit.

Surveillance can deter unauthorised access and detect intrusion. Surveillance personnel,
security cameras and alarms monitor and alert to unauthorised access.
The design of any security and surveillance system should be considered confidential.
Periodic testing is required to ensure that the system designed and implemented is functioning
properly. Camera and other surveillance systems, which collect personal information or may be
used to track and/or geo-locate an individual, may require special data protection consideration.
Consideration in the ENS
mp.if Protection of installations and infrastructure
mp.info.1 Personal data
7.9 Security of off-site equipment
Devices, including personal devices authorised for access, use and processing of organisational
information, need protection when they leave the premises. The organisation needs to know
which devices are used off-site, by whom and what information is accessed or used off-site.
Consideration in the ENS
mp.eq.3 Portable device protection
8.3 Restriction of access to information
Access to information and other assets should be based on the needs of each user, with access
being kept to a minimum and restricted to individual users. Information should not be accessible
to anonymous users to avoid untraceable and unauthorised access. This is important to preserve
the confidentiality of information, to monitor its use and to prevent unauthorised modification
and distribution.
Consideration in the ENS
op.acc.2 Access requirements
op.acc.3 Segregation of roles and tasks
